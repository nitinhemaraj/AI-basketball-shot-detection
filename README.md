# AI-basketball-shot-detection
A project with YOLOv8 to detect and analyze basketball shots in real-time. The algorithm tracks the ball's motion, applies data-cleaning techniques, and predicts its trajectory using linear regression to register successful shots when intersecting with the hoop. It enhances playing experience and offers game analytics.
